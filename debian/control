Description: provides fortune cookies on demand
 The vaticinator package provides a Python reimplemention of the
 'fortune' program.  The 'vaticinator' command supports most/all
 of the functionality of the original; also provided is a
 library of reusable fortune cookie functionality.  (Below is the
 description of the 'fortune' package.)
 .
 The fortune program displays epigrams, known as fortune cookies,
 selected randomly from a selection of fortune files.
 .
 This package provides the fortune program itself and the programs
 used for generating the data files. The data files are contained in
 the fortunes-min and fortunes packages.
